/**
 * Binary resolution for ffmpeg/ffprobe.
 *
 * Adapted carry-in of `@dsh-forge/plugin-ffmpeg` (MIT). ffmpeg/ffprobe ship as
 * platform binaries (or the ffmpeg-static npm shim), so resolution is
 * PATH-based. Missing binary is a BinaryNotFound tool error — never a silent
 * fallback.
 *
 * Resolution invariants (from external security review of the act plugin):
 *  1. NEVER return a bare name — on Windows, CreateProcess resolves a bare
 *     name by searching the parent process's cwd (often the workspace being
 *     analyzed) before PATH. Every resolved binary is an absolute path.
 *  2. When absent, return a RANDOM, non-existent absolute path (never a
 *     predictable path in a world-writable dir like /tmp). Spawning it yields
 *     ENOENT, which the core runner maps to BinaryNotFound.
 *  3. Relative PATH entries are skipped.
